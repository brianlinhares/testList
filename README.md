# testList

This exercise generates a list that can be manipulated by the user. Items can be added and removed. There is also a styles.css file included which allows the user to change the styles as preffered. 
To test the file, save it to your local machine, start BitBash and cd to the folder where the files are located. Start http-server, copy & paste the host address into your browser and try out the list app.
